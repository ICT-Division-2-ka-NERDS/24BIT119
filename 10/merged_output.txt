The cat sat on a mat.
He found an old book in the attic.
It was an old mat near the window.
A spider was crawling on the floor.
A bird flew over the house and sat on the tree.
The wind was strong and cold.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.They watched a movie under the stars.
She wore an elegant dress to the party.
